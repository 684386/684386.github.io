So, I _used to_ listen to a lot of different kinds of music, ranging from heavy-bass techno to 1700s Classical. But now that I've decided that I don't want to blend in, I started listening to the style of music that doesn't get as much recognition as it should: Intelligent Dance Music. I'm guessing that you know what Electronic music is, so let's just say it's the more... less bass-y kind of it. It's still made with computers, but now it's less harsh on the ears and sounds much better. However, it's an acquired taste; if I were to give you a sample of it right now, if you aren't a listener of it, then you would probably think that it sounds like the worst sound in the world. But after a while, it'll turn into the _only_ style of music that you listen to.
