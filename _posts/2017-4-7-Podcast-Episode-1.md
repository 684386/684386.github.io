My podcast, Mergers and Acquisitions is mostly about science and technology, and that's pretty much an extension of my blog. The first episode, called Who We Are, is about how big us humans _really_ are. We may seem quite extensive on this planet, but in reality, we are smaller than an atom on the grand scale of things. This episode brings in ideas from the 1990s classic, Carl Sagan's _Cosmos_, like the cosmic address.

Projected date of launch: April 14th
