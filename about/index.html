	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <p>First things first: I am a <strong>human</strong>. I may seem like a robot at first sight, but I assure you, I am a <em>Homo Sapien</em>. Although, if I were a robot, that would be cool... Oh well.</p>
	<p>At the moment, I live in Canada (You will never find out where I live! Or maybe you will...) with my mom and dad, because I am still [sigh] 11 years old. My pet is my MacBook Air, which I do everything on.</p>
	<p>
		I went through bullying for 5 years, which is the primary reason why I changed schools <em>again</em>, so that I wouldn't have to deal with bullies, though I still have flashbacks at times.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am currently developing an AI for Windows, macOS and Linux with Atom, and you can view it <a href="http://github.com/rishiosaur/Microphon">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am also working on <a href="http://github.com/rishiosaur/Rectangel.css">Rectangel</a>, a fully class-based CSS library which has customizeable responsiveness and many other things which I can't explain right now.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm usually referred to as "that one guy who codes"(Although that isn't so bad.)
	</p>
	<h3>{{ page.subtitle1 }}</h3>
	<p>To be honest, I am a fanatic when it comes to design. For me, that isn't really a weakness.</p>
	<p>Anyways, that was a sort-of brief explanation about the Rishi, the last <em>nerdus maximus</em>.</p>
