	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <p>First things first: I am a <strong>human</strong>. I may seem like a robot at first sight, but I assure you, I am a <em>Homo Sapien</em>. Although, if I were a robot, that would be cool... Oh well.</p>
	<p>At the moment, I am in Canada (You will never find out where I live! Or maybe you will...) with my mom and dad, because I am still [sigh] 12 years old. My pet is my MacBook Air, which I do everything on.</p>
	<p>
		I'm working on a <em>ton</em> of <a href="hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com" class="textlink">Hacktoberfest</a> projects, and yeah.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm usually referred to as "that one guy who codes"(Although that isn't so bad.)
	</p>
	<p>K cool.</p>
