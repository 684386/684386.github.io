Okay, so I might be a _little_ (okay, more than a little) biased today, due to the fact that it is Monday. Now, under usual circumstances, I like Mondays. However, I had a haircut, so I'm not feeling too well. Alright, to the weather. You know the color when you mix white and grey watercolour? Yeah, me neither. The sky was that color. Overall, it was warm, therefore proving that Canada is the home of Mother Nature. OK, time to go.
